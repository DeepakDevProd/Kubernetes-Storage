🚀 Kubernetes Storage Deep Dive — PV, PVC & Dynamic Provisioning

Today I explored how Kubernetes handles persistent storage the right way — from simple ephemeral volumes to AWS EBS-backed dynamic provisioning.

💡 Key Concepts I Covered:

emptyDir → Perfect for temporary data within a Pod’s lifecycle.

hostPath → Useful for system-level mounts (e.g., containerd sockets). Use only on trusted nodes.

PersistentVolume (PV) & PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) → Decoupled, cluster-managed storage that apps can safely claim and reuse.

StorageClass + Dynamic Provisioning → Request what you need; Kubernetes automatically provisions the right storage (no manual PV juggling!).

🧩 What I Set Up:

Default AWS gp2 StorageClass + an io1 option for higher IOPS.

EBS-backed PVs (2–10Gi) and matching PVCs.

MongoDB Deployment mounting PVCs for persistent data.

A simple emptyDir example for scratch space.

⚙️ Why It Matters:

Portable → Apps define their storage needs; the platform fulfils them.

Resilient → Data persists across pod restarts and rescheduling.

Scalable → Teams request storage with clear guardrails and policies.

✅ Pro Tip:
On AWS, set sensible defaults (like gp2) and use StorageClass policies to manage cost and sprawl. Start small, claim only what’s needed, and let dynamic provisioning handle the rest.
